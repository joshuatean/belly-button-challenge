# belly-button-challenge

## Purpose of the Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Requirements

1. The interactive dashboard contains a selectable dropdown box on the left which allows the user to select a particular subject ID. 
2. A section with the demographic information on the selected subject ID is displayed below the dropdown box.
3. A bar chart is generated by Plotly using the subject ID selected by the user, showing the top 10 microbial species in belly buttons.
4. A gauge chart is generated by Plotly towards the right of the dashboard showing the belly button washing frequency by the subject ID.
5. A bubble chart is generated by Plotly at the bottom of the dashboard showing the OTUs in belly buttons.
